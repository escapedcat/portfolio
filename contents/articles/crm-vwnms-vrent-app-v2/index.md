In the second phase of this project I focused on frontend ops, CI and deployment. Using xcode to manually create builds for iOS apps can take up a lot of time. I utilized gulp to create multiple tasks to handle the setup and build of the app via [Cordova][1]. From nothing to a downloadable app on [HockeyApp][2] without any manual work.
