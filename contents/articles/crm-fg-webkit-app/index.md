Single page app on AngularJS built with full test driven development, automation unit and end to end testing and continuous delivery. The app customizes the fairgarage search and experience to specific car workshops, loading only vehicle and pricing configuration that matches each specific workshop. Integrated on 20 000 workshops by end of 2014. I focused on and coordinated the templating and CSS structure.
